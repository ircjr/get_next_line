## About the project
> _This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor._

## ðŸ“‹ Testing

This command will compile your project and run the program, displaying the output with newline characters represented as **$**. Make sure to uncomment the main function in the **get_next_line.c** file before running and replace **<size>** with the desired buffer size.

```shell
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size> get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c && ./a.out | cat -e
```
